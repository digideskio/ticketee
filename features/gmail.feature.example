Feature: Gmail
  In order to send real world emails
  As the application
  I want to ensure my configuration is correct

  Background:
    Given there are the following users:
      | email                 | password      |
      | alice@ticketee.com    | password      |
      | youraccount@gmail.com | your_password |
    And Action Mailer delivers via SMTP

    Given there is a project called "TextMate 2"
    And "alice@ticketee.com" can view the "TextMate 2" project
    And "youraccount@gmail.com" can view the "TextMate 2" project
    And "youraccount@gmail.com" has created a ticket for this project:
      | title        | description       |
      | Release date | TBA very shortly. |

  # this scenario requires internet connection.
  # when you are running it without one, do this
  # bin/cucumber features --tag ~@nonet
  @nonet
  Scenario: Receiving a real-world email
    Given I am signed in as "alice@ticketee.com"
    Given I am on the homepage
    When I follow "TextMate 2"
    And I follow "Release date"
    And I fill in "Text" with "Posting a comment!"
    And I press "Create Comment"
    Then I should see "Comment has been created."
    When I log into gmail with:
      | username              | password      |
      | youraccount@gmail.com | your_password |
    Then there should be an email from Ticketee in my inbox
